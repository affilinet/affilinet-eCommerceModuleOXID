<h4><span style=" color: #90005B">Basket Tracking</span></h4>
<p>The affilinet basket tracking system allows you to submit shopping basket information on item level to affilinet. That information enables you to perform detailed statistical analyses and allows your publishers to optimize their marketing activities even further.</p>
<p>In the affilinet basket tracking system, we distinguish between baskets and basket items. Baskets can be confirmed and cancelled like regular transactions, but before you do this, you can update the contained basket items: you can update the quantity of single items or remove single items from the basket (e.g. if the article was returned by the customer); the publisher’s commission is automatically updated.</p>
<p>In order to evaluate the baskets even better, you can activate two additional tracking parameters (psub 1,2) in the cart tracking settings, which are only visible for the advertiser (you). You can specify whether you want to submit Magento default values as payment method or shipping method to be displayed in your statistics.</p>
<p>As product attributes you can submit additional parameters for the basket items as e. g. size, color, material etc.. These attributes will also be displayed in the publisher’s statistics for optimization purposes. Please transfer only data, which should be visible for publishers as well.</p>

<p>This technology enables you to re-address specifically interested customers. Potential customers, who left your online shop without a purchase, can be returned to your store via personalized ads (e. g. dynamic product banners). These ads will be displayed through affilinet retargeting publishers within their media reach.</p>
