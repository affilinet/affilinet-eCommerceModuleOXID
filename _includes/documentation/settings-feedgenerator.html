<p>The feed generator creates an affilinet matching product feed, based on your OXID eShop product database. You can check this feed in a few steps and submit it to affilinet. On the basis of this product datafeed publishers can build dynamic product ads and deliver them to specific target groups. So customers with a special product desire will come to your store.</p>

<h4><span style=" color: #90005B">How to setup a product feed?</span></h4><ul>
<li><b>Step 1 - Configuration:</b> Besides the affilinet standard feed you are able to create publisher individual product datafeeds (e. g.  for Valentine's Day, Easter or Christmas promotions).

</li>
<li><b>Step 2 - Preview/Export:</b> You can view the data of your feed, created in the first step, with a preview and generate a csv export.
