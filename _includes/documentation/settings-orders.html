<p>This module area enables you to view all orders, generated by customers, who were directed to your website by affilinet publishers. You can search for periods, publishers, channels as well as individual oderIDs and their transaction status and confirm or cancel order commissions.</p>

<p>If the order commissions will not be edited (confirmed/canceled) within the contractually defined time period, orders will be confirmed automatically. Orders with CPC (cost-per-click) based commission for publishers are not shown by defeault, because the commission must be paid for the click on a banner and not for an occurred purchase (order).</p>
